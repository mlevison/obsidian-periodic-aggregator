✅ parseDateFromKey has been replaced with obsidian-daily-notes-interface approach
  - Removed parseDateFromKey function that relied on guessing date formats
  - Now uses getDailyNote(moment, allDailyNotes) and getWeeklyNote(moment, allWeeklyNotes)
  - Iterates through date ranges using moment.js instead of parsing file keys
  - More robust as it uses the same logic as Obsidian's daily/weekly notes plugins
  - Handles different date formats automatically through the interface
  - Less prone to errors when users have custom date formats

✅ Added test cases covering the DateRange interface and documented the architectural improvements

## Next potential improvements:
- Add integration tests that verify the actual obsidian-daily-notes-interface behavior
- Consider adding error handling for when daily/weekly notes plugins are not installed
- Optimize performance by caching notes retrieval if needed for large date ranges
