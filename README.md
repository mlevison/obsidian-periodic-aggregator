# Quarterly/Weekly Review Builder
An Obsidian plugin that speeds up quarterly (and weekly) reviews, by consolidating Daily and Weekly notes into a single file.

This plugin, was born out of a quarterly review, where I was frustrated with the process of flipping through 13 weekly notes, wondered if I was missing something important.

Now each quarter, I have two files to look at: quarterly_days.md and quarterly_weeks.md. In a world of GenAI, having only two files makes it easier to do a final check at each step the review process. Using your AI tool of choice (Obsidian Copilot in my case), I point the tool at my review file file and the `quarterly_days.md` and `quarterly_weeks.md` files. I ask questions like "looking at my review file so far, is there anything I missed?"

## Commands
- **Build Quarterly Review** - asks which quarter to compile notes for, then finds all the Daily and Weekly notes from the Quarter.
- **Build Weekly Review** - asks which week to compile notes for, then finds all the Daily notes from the Week. It also adds the previous week's review file at the top of the file.

## Settings
- **Temp Folder**: Select which folder to use for temporary files.
